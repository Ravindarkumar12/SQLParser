There is no universally standardized set of SQL error codes that applies to all database systems. Each database system typically defines its own set of error codes. However, some database systems do share common error codes or use standard SQL states to categorize errors. Here are a few examples:

SQL State: 23000
Error Code: integrity_constraint_violation
Message: An integrity constraint (such as a unique key or foreign key constraint) has been violated.

SQL State: 23505
Error Code: unique_violation
Message: An attempt to insert or update data resulted in a duplicate key violation.

SQL State: 42S02
Error Code: table_not_found
Message: The specified table does not exist in the database.

SQL State: 42000
Error Code: syntax_error
Message: There is a syntax error in the SQL statement.

SQL State: 08001
Error Code: connection_failure
Message: The connection to the database could not be established.
